        I specialize in front-end technologies, crafting engaging and user-friendly interfaces. 
        While Iâ€™m still mastering back-end development, I'm actively expanding my knowledge in that area. 
        I also have a keen interest in cybersecurity and web exploitation, dedicating time to learn best practices in the field. 
        My skills enable me to manage complex projects effectively, whether meeting deadlines or collaborating with a team. 
        With a strong attention to detail and problem-solving abilities, I ensure that every project is well-planned and executed.
